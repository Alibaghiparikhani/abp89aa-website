        <section id="early-life">
            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>I was born in Tehran on August 9th, 2004. Due to my father's job, we moved around a lot during my childhood.</p>
            <p>I attended the elementary school at Tabriz, specifically Shafhage Roshan School. I cherished my time there, and they provided me with a strong foundation.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="education-tehran">
            <h2>Education in Tehran</h2>
            <p>After moving to Tehran, I continued my education at Valeh and Salam Shahid Hemmat schools.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="education-istanbul">
            <h2>Education in Istanbul</h2>
            <p>Eventually, we relocated to Istanbul, where I attended Okyanus Atasehir High School.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="university-admission">
            <h2>University Admission</h2>
            <p>In my final year of high school, I took the SAT exam and achieved a score of 1530. This allowed me to gain admission to Ko√ß University's Computer Engineering program with a 50% scholarship.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="linguistic-abilities">
            <h2>Linguistic Abilities</h2>
            <p>Although my mother tongue is Azerbaijani Turkish, I have been learning languages throughout my life. I can speak Azerbaijani, Turkish, Persian, English, German, and Arabic.</p>
            <p>I plan to learn Spanish, French, and Russian in the future.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="career-focus">
            <h2>Career Focus</h2>
            <p>In terms of my academic and professional aspirations, I am particularly interested in the field of AI and machine learning within computer engineering.</p>
            <p>While obtaining a master's degree in these fields is not a current goal, I might pursue it later in life. What I would really like is to work at companies such as OpenAI where the focus is on AI.</p>
